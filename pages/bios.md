Hello there! My name is William Braga. I am a third-year undergraduate Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. I will graduate this semester and begin my Master’s in the spring. My specialties are in Intelligence – the areas within machine learning – and Information Internetworks – the ways in which computing systems are created and layered. One of my favorite classes was Natural Language Processing, where I learned the ways in which language can be modeled and understood by a computer. For our final project, my friend and I created a recipe generator that would come up with never-before-seen (usually for good reason) dishes.

Since Fall 2019, I have worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CS 2050: Intro to Discrete Mathematics. As the go-between for the instructor and students, I often mediate conflicting interests. Even though it may sometimes be impossible to accommodate all sides, I have always valued fairness and open communication. I never want someone to feel like they were not heard. In the future, I hope to avoid working for a company that focuses only on proprietary, closed-design solutions. I think clients have the right to be fully informed of what they are buying and the objective of the server.

Hi there, I’m Nick Cooke, a fourth year computer science major at Georgia Tech. In my free time, I enjoy building apps that help people accomplish everyday tasks faster and easier.

Over the summer I worked at Google building tools for app developers. While there, I accomplished numerous things, but my favorite was writing about how the tools Google builds can help people make apps faster and easier. Some of my work was published on one of Google’s Medium publications. 

I’m very much a self-starter and enjoy working hard. As far as values, I value honesty, kindness, and empathy. Learning motivates me, and I love helping others around me learn too! This being said, I’d like to grow my career into a position working as a developer advocate, where I can share my knowledge with other developers and use their experiences and feedback to better the software my team creates.

Oh hey! I’m Markian Hromiak, a fifth year computer science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology focusing in artificial intelligence and low-level system design. When I’m not researching you can find me cooking, climbing, knitting, playing trumpet and piano --- it’s never too late to learn something new.

I have two years internship experience as a software engineer and have more recently debuted in the area of AI research by publishing on arXiv. I am also pursuing a patent for an eyewear technology that will let one pair fit most prescriptions. My philosophy behind creating anything is that its value increases the more people’s lives it changes for the better.

Currently I am simultaneously applying to graduate schools in hope of pursuing a PhD in artificial intelligence and cognitive architectures and searching for software engineering positions in industry so that no matter where I end up I can create things
