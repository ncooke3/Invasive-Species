**Non-native/alien:** not originating from the area in which something exists

**Invasive species:** a species that, when introduced to an ecosystem it is not native to,  disrupts and negatively affects the surrounding ecosystem

**Accidental release:** the undeliberate introduction of an alien species into an environment (i.e. ballast water containing zebra mussels being released in waters non-native to zebra mussels, thus introducing mussels as an alien species)

**Pet release:** invasive species that were once pets and either escaped captivity or were intentionally released by their owners because they were unwanted

**Horticulture:** the act of managing and cultivating plants

**Ballast water:** water held in the ballast tanks of a boat to aid vessel stabilization

**Ameliorate:** To make (something bad or unsatisfactory) better.

**Biodiversity:** The variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem.

**Environment:** The surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates.

**Biome:** A large naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat, e.g. forest or tundra.

**Ecosystem:** A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Closely related to the term ‘biome’.

**Eradication:** The complete removal of any invasive individuals and their (potential) offspring. This reactive measure has been considered the most effective recourse, but it is usually only feasible in specific areas like small islands. 

**Control:** Lowers the number of invasive individuals in an area. This involves the active reduction of invasive populations. Any control should be paired with ecological research on how the invasive species has integrated with the new environment. 

**Containment:** The prevention of invasive spread. Existing populations can be sectioned off and blocked from accessing new locations.

**Trophic Cascade:** The cascading impact a species may have on a food web. Ecological research identifies the potential of such a cascade resulting from an invasive species’ actions.
