**Accidental release:** The undeliberate introduction of an alien species into an environment (i.e. ballast water containing zebra mussels being released in waters non-native to zebra mussels, thus introducing mussels as an alien species).

**Ameliorate:** To make (something bad or unsatisfactory) better.

**Ballast water:** Water held in the ballast tanks of a boat to aid vessel stabilization.

**Biodiversity:** The variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem.

**Biome:** A large naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat, e.g. forest or tundra.

**Containment:** The prevention of invasive spread. Existing populations can be sectioned off and blocked from accessing new locations.

**Control:** Lowers the number of invasive individuals in an area. This involves the active reduction of invasive populations. Any control should be paired with ecological research on how the invasive species has integrated with the new environment. 

**Ecosystem:** A biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Closely related to the term ‘biome’.

**Environment:** The surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates.

**Eradication:** The complete removal of any invasive individuals and their (potential) offspring. This reactive measure has been considered the most effective recourse, but it is usually only feasible in specific areas like small islands. 

**Horticulture:** The act of managing and cultivating plants.

**Invasive species:** A species that, when introduced to an ecosystem it is not native to,  disrupts and negatively affects the surrounding ecosystem.

**Non-native/alien:** Not originating from the area in which something exists.

**Pet release:** Invasive species that were once pets and either escaped captivity or were intentionally released by their owners because they were unwanted.

**Trophic Cascade:** The cascading impact a species may have on a food web. Ecological research identifies the potential of such a cascade resulting from an invasive species’ actions.
