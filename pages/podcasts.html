    In this week’s episode, we sit down with Lisa, a park ranger in the Florida Everglades. 
    The focus of this episode is to dive into how Florida is fighting to rid their state of 
    a slithering invasive species– the Burmese python! Lisa informs us of the risk these 
    snakes pose to native wildlife and the roles she takes on as a park ranger to eradicate 
    this invasive species from Florida’s environment. Lisa also explains why it’s best to 
    track the pythons before eliminating them. As always, we wrap up our episode discussing 
    how the average resident or tourist of Florida can step in to make a difference in 
    fighting this invasive species!
